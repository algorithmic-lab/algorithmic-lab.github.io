# Injective Hulls
The injective hull of a graph G is a unique smallest Helly graph H(G) into which G isometrically embeds. Here are a few graphs embedded into their precomputed injective hulls. Some graph parameters are calculated, such as the Helly-gap of each graph and the number of vertices and edges in G and H(G).
