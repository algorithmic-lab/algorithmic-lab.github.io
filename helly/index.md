# Injective Hulls
The injective hull of a graph G is a unique smallest Helly graph H(G) into which G isometrically embeds. Here are a few graphs embedded into their precomputed injective hulls.


## Cycles
* [G]({% link helly/c4.md %}) = C_4
* G = C_5
* G = C_6
* G = C_7
* G = C_8, and powers G^2, and G^3
* G = C_9, and powers G^2, G^3, and G^4
* G = C_10, and powers G^2, G^3, and G^4
* G = C_11, and powers G^2, G^3, G^4, and G^5
* G = C_12, and powers G^2, G^3, G^4, and G^5

## Other known graphs
* 3-fan
* 3-fan + grid
* Hypercube
* Krackhardt-Kite
* Petersen
* Chvatal
* Icosahedral
* Domino + 2C_3
* Fat domino + 2C_3

## Exemplary graphs
* A permutation graph
* A graph with isometric C_8
